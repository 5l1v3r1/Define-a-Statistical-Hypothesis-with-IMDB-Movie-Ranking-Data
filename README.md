# correlation-of-IMDB-votes-by-age-groups

My theoretical hypothesis is; “The evaluations of citizens about foreign movies are not influenced by the governments' official policy”. 

Because of the exhaustive hypothesis, it is not easyto collect data. So I decided to restrict the hypothesis in the example of the USand its politically affair tense countries; Russia and Iran. I used “the ratings of US citizensabout Iranian and Russian movies” and “the ratings of Non-US people about Iranand Russian movies” data from IMDB.

We need two data, which are the rating data of US citizens and Non-USpeople about Iranian and Russian movies. At IMDB, these data exist for everymovies. We can see that 15.115 Russian and 6.923 Iranian movies exist as of08.09.2019. To prevent the noise, to avoid the falsity and to reach the healthyresult; only the movies were taken into account,  which has 5000 or more votes. So ourpopulation is “the rating data of (37+62) 99  movies”.
